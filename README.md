Ideas/Projects
* more info on each "category" IE if you hit tree waste give a good explanation as to what that is
* node server to handle push notifications because local push notifications seem to be a total mess on cordova and have too many limitions (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17877528/how-to-schedule-more-local-notifications-in-ios-when-notification-crosses-limit)
* Interested in adding more data if anyone has any good data sources.
* #crazyidea nation-wide database of pickup regions with tooling to allow cities and citizens to manage it
* Drop off locations
